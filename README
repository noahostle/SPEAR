All credits for the authorship of SEPAR_Cipher go to arsalanvahi on github.

I made slight modifications to the source in order to make it more modular (to work with my script), hence the reupload of \SEPAR_Cipher.

See SPEAR.py for usage and description.

See Arxiv\DOI_TBA for detailed explaination of attack
